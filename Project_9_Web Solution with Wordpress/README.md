#   Understanding 3 Tier Architecture
##  Web Solution with WordPress

-   WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) written in hypertext preprocessor language[PHP] and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database with supported HTTPS. 

-   WordPress is a factory that makes webpages: It stores content and enables a user to create and publish webpages, requiring nothing beyond a domain and a hosting service.

-   Generally, web, or mobile solutions are implemented based on what is called the Three-tier Architecture; a client-server software architecture pattern that comprise of 3 separate layers: 

1.  Presentation Layer (PL): This is the user interface such as the client server or browser on your laptop.

2.  Business Layer (BL): This is the backend program that implements business logic. Application or Webserver 

3.  Data Access or Management Layer (DAL): This is the layer for computer data storage and data access. Database Server 

    or File System Server such as FTP server, or NFS Server.

In this project, we shall:

-   Configure storage subsystem for Web and Database servers based on Linux OS. This part focuses on practical experience of working with disks, partitions and volumes in Linux.

-   Install WordPress and connect it to a remote MySQL database server. This part will soldify our skills of deploying Web and DB tiers of Web solution.

##  Step 1 â€” Prepare a Web Server

1.   Launch an EC2 instance that will serve as "Web Server". Create 3 EBS volumes in the same AZ as your Web Server EC2,

    each of 10 GiB size.

2.   Attach each of the EBS volumes to your web server instance.

3.   Open up the Linux terminal to begin configuration, ssh into your server.

4.   Use `lsblk` command to inspect what block devices are attached to the server. All devices in Linux reside in /dev/
 
    directory. Inspect it with ls /dev/ and make sure you see all 3 newly created block devices there; their names will 
 
    likely be xvdf, xvdh, xvdg.

5.  Use `df -h` command to see all mounts and free space on the server.

6.  Use gdisk utility to create a single partition (10GB) on each of the 3 disks:

`sudo gdisk /dev/xvdf`
`sudo gdisk /dev/xvdg`
`sudo gdisk /dev/xvdh`

7.  Use `lsblk` utility to view the newly configured partition on each of the 3 disks.

8.  Install `lvm2` package using `sudo yum install lvm2`. Run `sudo lvmdiskscan` command to check for available 

    partitions.

9.  Use `pvcreate` utility to mark each of 3 disks as physical volumes (PVs) to be used by LVM.

`sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdf1 pvcreate /dev/xvdg1 pvcreate /dev/xvdh1`

10. Verify that the physical volumes were created successfully by running `sudo pvs`.

11. Using the `vgcreate` utility, create a volume group named `webdata-vg` and add all the three PVS to the volume group.

`sudo vgcreate webdata-vg /dev/xvdh1 /dev/xvdg1 /dev/xvdf1`

![alt text](<image_9/Screenshot 2024-04-17 035014.png>)

12. Verify that the volume group was created successfully using `sudo vgs`

![alt text](<image_9/Screenshot 2024-04-17 035235.png>)

13. Using the `lvcreate`  utility, create two logical volumes(LVs); `apps-lv` and `logs-lv`. Assign each LVs about half

 of the volume group size which is about 30GB. I assigned both 14GB size; apps-lv will be used to store data for the 

 Website while logs-lv will be used to store data for logs. Using this command below.

 `sudo lvcreate -n apps-lv -L 14G webdata-vg`

`sudo lvcreate -n logs-lv -L 14G webdata-vg`

![alt text](<image_9/Screenshot 2024-04-17 040419.png>)

14. Verify that the LVs were created successfully using `sudo lvs`.

15. Verify the entire setup. Using this command.

`sudo vgdisplay -v #view complete setup - VG, PV, and LV`

`sudo lsblk`
