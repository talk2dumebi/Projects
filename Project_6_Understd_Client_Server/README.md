##  Client-Server Architecture with MYSQL

### Client-server architecture is a common approach to building distributed software systems. In this architecture, there are two main components: the client and the server. The client is the user interface, or front-end, of the application, while the server is the back-end that handles data storage and processing. One of the most widely used server-side technologies for data storage is MySQL, an open-source relational database management system.
